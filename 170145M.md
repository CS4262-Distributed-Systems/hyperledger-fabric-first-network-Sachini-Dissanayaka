- **Smart Contracts** - A smart contract is a program stored in a blockchain to ensure the security of the chain. It runs when a pre-defined set of conditions are satisfied. This can be used to automate the execution of an agreement and trigger the next action to continue the execution flow.

- **Permissioned and Permissionless Blockchains** - Permissionless blockchains are blockchain networks where anyone is allowed to participate and be a validator, while permissioned blockchains only allow authorized clients to be validators. These authorized clients are a set of known participants operating under a governance model. Hyperledger Fabric comes under this category.
